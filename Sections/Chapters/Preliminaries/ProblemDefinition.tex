\label{problemdefinition}
With the problem analysis completed, a problem definition has been defined in this chapter.

In chapter \ref{preliminaries:problemanalysis}, the problem of citizens falling and the consequences of this were analyzed. From this it was concluded, that fall accidents is a major expense for the danish health sector, since roughly 1/3 of danish citizens over the age of 65 has a fall accident once a year. The most severe cases of fall accidents are those where the fallen citizen is unable to get up my them self, which is what has become the focus of this project.

In chapter \ref{preliminaries:existingsolutions} existing solutions were analyzed. Through the chapter many different solutions, with a myriad of different approaches to the problem, were discovered. One thing that many of these had in common, were that they all depend on dedicated devices to function and some sort of manned call center. To build upon these, a new smart solution could implement voice recognition to detect fall accidents and make it possible to connect different devices to better suit each case.

In chapter \ref{chap:technologies}, possible technologies that were taken into consideration as viable devices and their usage were explored. It was concluded that a possible solution could be implemented using a smartphone app, personal assistant

Based on that we have come up with the following problem definition:
\begin{center}
  \textit{How can the problem of fall accidents, where the citizen is not able to get up by themselves, be assisted by a smart solution, integrating smartphones and personal assistant technologies in a web based solution?}  
\end{center}
