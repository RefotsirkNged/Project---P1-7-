\section*{Initiating problem}
Using this introduction to the subject of the report, the following initial problem statement has been defined:

\begin{center}
    How can a system be developed, to help the elderly citizens get the help they need when a falling accident occurs, using IoT devices?
\end{center}

Furthermore, we have defined the following sub-questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Who among the elderly is subject to falling?
\item What existing solutions already try and solve the problem?
\item Which platforms (both hardware and software) would be best suited for the problem?
\item What kind of IoT devices can be utilized in this context?
\end{itemize}
