Throughout this first part of the report, the problem area, as introduced in the \textit{introduction}, has been analyzed. This has been done, to concertize the initial problem and to make a foundation for developing a solution that can help solve this problem. This has been done by first analyzing the concrete problem of fall accidents. After this, different scenarios have been explored, and from these, some are chosen to limit the scope of this project. With this done, some of the existing solutions that tries to solve the same problem are explored to get a better idea of which issues was already solved. Lastly different kinds of technologies have been examined, to determine which of these are suited for a new smart solution. All of this then leads to a concrete problem definition that has been used as a base for the rest of the project.
